SKY PIRATES REVIEW
---
Sky Pirates is an arcade-style game that was developed by Spastic Badger Studios for the 2022 Arcade Project in Pierce County Skills Center (Puyallup, WA). The player flies in a plane avoiding enemies & obstacles coming from the right side of the screen, earning points with each enemy defeated. It contains dialogue from other characters, a shop in which you 'buy' powerups, and boss battles against blimps!

Our team, a game development team, was also in collaboration with an ITS & Cybersecurity team, as well as an Aerospace Composites team. This was because we were all working to create an arcade. We were tasked with creating the game, but we also came up with the controls, as well. We decided on 8 directional movement using a joystick. The two buttons acted as a firing mode and an strong fire ability (with a cooldown).
